    "* \"filtfilt\" is zero-phase filtering, which doesn't shift the signal as it filters. Since the phase is zero at all frequencies, it is also linear-phase. Filtering backwards in time requires you to predict the future, so it can't be used in \"online\" real-life applications, only for offline processing of recordings of signals.\n",
